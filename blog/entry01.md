## Picking my Topic

For my SEP10 Freedom Project I had a couple topics to choose from. I was intrested in Medical practice, baking/cooking, and jewelry designer. I'm intrested in these topics because I always wanted to work in the medical field or anything with medicine. I always wanted to know how the hospital has records of everything and they can pull it up in just a click, It also amazes me on how the hospital can figure out a cure or something to make the pain go away for some time being. For baking/cooking I feel like those is just a hobby for me like whenever I want a sweet treat I could just bake, or if its just cooking a meal for everyone to eat.


#### Medical Practice
While researching my topic Medical practice, I searched up "Medical Practice used in Technology Industry" and there was a article
"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8285156/". There was a part that stood out to me, "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful and disruptive area of computer science, with the potential to fundamentally transform the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare". This stood out to me because they are able to use technology to transform the practice of medical and health care delivery.

#### Cooking/baking
While researching my topic cooking/baking I searched up "baking in technology industry” and this article popped up "https://magazinebbm.com/blog/technology-and-production-equipment-in-the-bakery-industry2796#:~:text=Automated%20mixing%20and%20kneading%20systems%2C%20high%2Dspeed%20ovens%20and%20proofers,technology%20equipment%20reshaping%20the%20industry". Although its very long I was reading through it and this part caught my attention, "High-Speed Ovens and Proofers. This can cook/ bake the food in the oven faster and quicker. Automated Decorating and Icing Machines". I think technology being used this way is very cool because instead of waiting 30-40 for the cake to bake it can bake faster in 5-10 minutes.

#### Jewelry Designer
While researching about jewelry designers I search up "how do u use tech in jewelry design industry” I found a good article that talked about how you can try on the jewelry virtually to see if the design will look good on. the article was "https://www.jaesjewelers.com/blogs/news/how-technology-is-shaping-jewelry-design-in-2025". "3D Printing: Precision and Creativity Augmented Reality (AR) Try-Ons: Virtual Elegance". In the article it stated that you can use 3d printing.
