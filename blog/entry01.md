## Picking my Topic

For my SEP10 Freedom Project I had a couple topics to choose from. I was intrested in Medical practice, baking/cooking, and jewelry designer. Im intrested in these topics because I always wanted to work in the medical field or anything with medicine. I always wanted to know how the hospital has records of everything and they can pull it up in just a click, It also amazes me on how the hospital can figure out a cure or something to make the pain go away for some time being. For baking/cooking i feel like those is just a hobby for me like whenever i want a sweet treat i could just bake, or if its just cooking a meal for everyone to eat.


### Medical Practice
While researching my topic Medical practice, i searched up "medical practice used in technology industry" and there was a article
"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8285156/". There was a part that stood out to me, "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful and disruptive area of computer science, with the potential to fundamentally transform the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare". this stood out to me because they are able to use technology to transform the practice of medical and health care delivery.
