## Picking my Topic

For my SEP10 Freedom Project I had a couple topics to choose from. I was intrested in Medical practice, baking/cooking, and jewelry designer. Im intrested in these topics because I always wanted to work in the medical field or anything with medicine. For baking/cooking i feel like those is just a hobby for me like whenever i want a sweet treat i could just bake, or if its just cooking a meal for everyone to eat.
