### Software Technologies:
One technology I found is called **Electronic Health Record (EHR) System**. These help doctors and nurses look up a patient’s medical history with just a click, so they don’t have to search through papers or files. It also helps them communicate with  each other and prevents making mistakes. A popular EHR program is called Epic Systems, which helps keep track of data, appointments, and even sends alerts if a medicine might not be safe for a patient. [This link is a PDF from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services explaining how Electronic Health Record systems work and how to keep them secure.](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/electronic-health-record-systems.pdf) I also found out about **AI diagnostic tools**, such as IBM Watson Health. This software can look at X-rays and lab results and help doctors find problems quicker and more accurately. I thought that was really interesting because it shows how computers can actually help save lives.


### Hardware Technologies:
I learned about robotic surgery tools, like the **da Vinci Surgical System**. This lets doctors do surgery using robotic arms, which are super precise and can make smaller cuts so patients heal faster. [This link explains what the da Vinci system is.](https://health.utoledo.edu/clinics/urology/oldstuff/davinci/index.html) I also found out about **wearable health monitors**, like patches that *track your heart rate or blood sugar*. These send information straight to doctors, so they can ***catch problems early***. I think it’s really amazing how software and hardware work together in medicine. Most people don't even realize that technology is the reason we get faster results, safer treatments, and better care when we go to the doctor.

### How I Did My Research:

To learn about the **software** and **hardware** used in **medical practice**, I searched online using keywords like “_medical practice technology_,” “_electronic health records_,” and “_robotic surgery tools_.” I looked at official websites, PDFs from trusted sources, and articles that explained how these technologies work and help patients and doctors. I also revised my searches a few times to make sure I was finding reliable and clear information. For example, I only used websites that end in ***.edu*** and ***.gov***, because anyone can create a ***.com*** website, which may contain false information. Robotic surgery article from UAMS Health: shows benefits of the da Vinci system like less pain, less blood loss, faster recovery. [UAMS says da Vinci surgery is precise and causes less damage](https://uamshealth.com/treatment/da-vinci-robotic-surgery). 
* Da Vinci Robotic Surgery: Minimally invasive surgery controlled by a surgeon via robotic arms.
* How it Works: Small instruments + 3D camera, every movement directed by the surgeon.
* Benefits: Less pain, scarring, and blood loss, faster recovery.
* Patient Recovery: Patients often return to normal activities sooner with better results.

### Engineering Design Process:
I am currently in the research and planning stage of the Engineering Design Process. I’ve gathered a lot of information about both software and hardware technologies used in the medical field. My next step in the Engineering Design Process is to start designing how I want my website to look. My vision for my website is for each part to have its own section, and for it to be *organized*. I want to add pictures that go with what I'm writing because it can help whoever is reading my website visually see what I'm talking about. I'm going to organize the website into sections like “*Software*”, “*Hardware*”, and “*Future Technology*” to make it easy to read. 

### Skills:
After my first blog I have a few skills that will help me more. 
* I’ve learned how to *search for better examples* instead of just picking the first link that comes up. I’ve also been changing my searches, like going from “medical technology” to “hardware used in hospitals,” and I get more useful results.
* I’ve been *keeping my notes and information organized*, making sure each link goes with the right note. This makes it easier to find things later and saves time.
* I’m getting *better at explaining* what I’ve learned so other people can understand it. I don’t just say random things and hope they get it. 
* I’ve also learned how to *~make links short and work properly~*, instead of having long messy URLs.

### Reflection:
I learned about **_software_** like **Electronic Health Records** and **AI diagnostic tools**, and **_hardware_** like the **da Vinci Surgical System** and **wearable health monitors**. Researching these technologies taught me how they improve patient care and make medical work more efficient. I also improved my skills in searching for reliable sources, organizing information, and explaining ideas clearly. I plan to use these skills when I start designing my website so it is easy to read and informative.”
