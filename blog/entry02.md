### Software Technologies:
One thing I found is called Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems. These help doctors and nurses look up a patient’s medical history with just a click, so they don’t have to search through papers or files. It also helps them talk to each other and prevents making mistakes. A popular EHR program is called Epic Systems, which helps keep track of data, appointments, and even sends alerts if a medicine might not be safe for a patient. [This link is a PDF from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services explaining how Electronic Health Record systems work and how to keep them secure.](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/electronic-health-record-systems.pdf) I also found out about AI Diagnostic Tools, like IBM Watson Health. This software can look at X-rays and lab results and help doctors find problems quicker and more accurately. I thought that was really interesting because it shows how computers can actually help save lives.


### Hardware Technologies:
I learned about robotic surgery tools, like the da Vinci Surgical System. This lets doctors do surgery using robotic arms, which are super precise and can make smaller cuts so patients heal faster. [This link explain what what the da Vinci system is.](https://health.utoledo.edu/clinics/urology/oldstuff/davinci/index.html) I also found out about wearable health monitors, like patches that track your heart rate or blood sugar. These send information straight to doctors, so they can catch problems early. I think it’s really amazing how software and hardware work together in medicine. Most people don't even realize technology is the reason we get faster results, safer treatments, and better care when we go to the doctor.
