Topic: **Medical Practice**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* For my Freedom Project I picked the topic Medical Practice, I first searched up medical practice apps and 3 popped up "Virtual Practice Healthcare, Jotform Health, and NHS App". But the one that looked more interesting was Virtual Practice Healthcare with the loco being a stethoscope. 
* Healthcare tech is moving fast, it’s mostly from mobile apps.  Virtual Practice Healthcare apps  let doctors and patients connect online, so people will be able to get care from home. Instead of going to a doctor’s office, patients  will be able to  have video calls, ask questions, and even get prescriptions all right from their phone. It makes healthcare easier and more convenient, especially when you can't make it to a clinic or prefer not to leave the house.

## Part A: existing technology
***Epic Systems***

What It Is: Epic is a huge software used by hospitals and big medical offices to keep track of patient info, like health records and appointments.

**What It Does:**

* Keeps Patient Info Organized: It stores everything about a patient’s health, like medical history, medications, and test results.

* Telemedicine: Doctors can see patients over video calls, so you don’t always have to go to the office.

* Appointments & Scheduling: Helps doctors keep track of patient appointments.

* Billing: It handles all the insurance stuff and makes sure the doctors get paid.

**How It Helps:**

* Faster Access to Info: Doctors can quickly see your medical history, so they can make better decisions.

* Less Mistakes: It helps reduce errors in billing and appointment scheduling, making everything smoother.

* Improves Care: Doctors have everything they need at their fingertips, so they can give you better care.

* Meets Standards: It's made to follow healthcare rules, so your data is safe.

***Zocdoc***

What It Is: Zocdoc is an app/website where you can book doctor appointments online. You can find doctors, check their ratings, and book a visit without having to call.

What It Does:

* Online Booking: You can pick a time to see a doctor that works for you, even for same-day appointments.

* Find Doctors: You can search for doctors by what you need (like a dentist or pediatrician), where they are, and which insurance they accept.

* Insurance Help: It shows which doctors take your insurance, so you don’t have to guess.

* Patient Reviews: You can read other people's reviews about doctors before making an appointment.

* Telehealth: You can also have video calls with doctors if you don’t want to go in person.

How It Helps:

* Easy Booking: You can find and book a doctor without waiting on hold or having to call.

* Saves Time: No more waiting for weeks to see a doctor, you can often find last-minute spots.

## Part B: possible future technology

## Devices/hardware

So I first searched up "Devices used in medical practice". and it showed many sources from the web.
* But there was a AI overview but since AI can be incorrect I scrolled past it.  Most of the devices that are being used aren’t hardware, it shows Stethoscope, Blood pressure monitors, Glucose meter, Thermometer, and insulin. These devices aren't plugged into anything so it doesn’t make them hardware.
  Examples

### Blood Pressure Monitor
* A Blood pressure monitor is used by batteries, and you don't plug it into anything. You just wrap it around your upper arm near your pulse and the part with the circle wire you put on the pulse, push the button and it inflates air to stop blood flow and it
* Important to keep arm at heart-level, cuff size matters, multiple readings often taken.
* Use: diagnosis/monitoring of hypertension, cardiovascular risk.

### Glucose Meter
* It is used for measuring your blood glucose. It is commonly used by people that have diabetes.
* A drop of blood is placed on a test strip, and you insert it into the meter, and it measures your blood glucose levels.
* If the number is too high it can be dangerous but it can also be dangerous if the number is too low. 
* You're also supposed to measure it before you eat breakfast because it can have an effect if you measure after eating. 
* Hardware: small reader, test strip interface, display, often battery powered.

### Pulse Oximeter
* A Pulse Oximeter Measures how much oxygen is in your blood (SpO₂) and your pulse rate.
* You clip it on your finger. It shines red and infrared light through your skin, and a sensor measures how much light your blood absorbs to find your oxygen level.
* It has small finger clip with tiny LED lights, a sensor, and a screen to show the numbers.
* Use: Checks oxygen levels for people with breathing problems, during surgery, or at home.

### Thermometer 
* Measures body temperature to check for fever or infection.
* Normal body temperature: Around 98.6°F (37°C), but it can range from 97°F–99°F (36.1–37.2°C) depending on the person, time of day, and where it’s measured.
* Hardware: thermistor or infrared sensor, display. Infrared ear and forehead thermometers read body heat, while digital mouth and underarm thermometers touch the skin to measure temperature.
[Thermometer image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQngHgfzDvoPD9aaoNZ5MPVyCz_yIlwYBjCjA&s)

There is 4 different types of thermometers
* Digital Thermometer used for Oral (under the tongue), axillary (underarm), and rectal (for babies) readings are common.
* Infrared Thermometer (Ear/Forehead): Measures heat coming from your eardrum or forehead skin.
* Mercury Thermometer (Traditional): Contains mercury that rises with heat — no longer widely used because mercury is toxic. Digital
* No-Contact Thermometers: Use infrared light but do not touch the skin at all. Common during public health screenings.

### Defibrillator
* A defibrillator is a machine that sends an electric shock to the heart.
* It helps the heart start beating normally again during a heart attack or abnormal rhythm.
* It has Big batteries, Wires and high-voltage parts, Paddles or sticky pads, Buttons and a screen, ECG monitor to check the heartbeat, Some have AED (automated) features that work by themselves.
* Used in emergencies to restart the heart and save lives.

### Electrocardiography Machine
* It records the heart’s electrical activity using electrodes on the body.
* Electrodes pick up the heart’s signals, wires send them to the machine, the amplifier makes them stronger, the converter changes them into a readable form, and the screen or printout shows them.
* Check arrhythmias: the electrodes and lead wires detect irregular beats, the screen/printout shows them.
* Detect heart attacks: the amplifier and converter make changes in heart signals visible. 
* Monitor heart function: the whole system records and displays the heart’s activity for ongoing observation.

### Ventilator
* It helps/takes over a patient’s breathing.
* Gas flow system delivers air/oxygen, sensors check pressure and volume, the user interface lets doctors adjust settings, alarms warn of problems, and ventilator circuits connect the machine to the patient.
* Use: Used in ICU, during surgery, for respiratory failure, or under anesthesia.

### Ultrasound 
* Uses high-frequency sound waves to make pictures of inside the body.
* The probe (transducer) sends and receives sound waves, the console processes the signals with beamforming electronics, the display shows the images, and user controls let the operator adjust settings.
* Use: Helps doctors check the heart, abdomen, baby in pregnancy, blood vessels, and guide procedures like biopsies.

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanner
* Uses strong magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body.
* The magnet creates a strong magnetic field, gradient coils adjust the field to focus on specific areas, RF coils send and receive radio signals, the computer processes the data, and the display shows the images.
* Use: Used for detailed imaging of the brain, spine, joints, and soft tissues.

### Autoclave
* Sterilizes surgical tools and lab equipment using steam under pressure.
* Pressure chamber holds the items, steam generator creates high-pressure steam, timers control the cycle, sensors check temperature and pressure, and safety features prevent accidents.
* Use: Keeps hospitals, clinics, and labs free from infections.

### Electrosurgical Unit (ESU)
* Cuts or stops bleeding in tissue using high-frequency electricity during surgery.
* The generator makes electricity, cables carry it, the handpiece touches the tissue, the ground pad completes the circuit safely, and the controls let the surgeon adjust it.
* Use: Used in operating rooms for surgeries like laparoscopic, open, or endoscopic procedures.
