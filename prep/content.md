Topic: **Medical Practice**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* For my Freedom Project I picked the topic Medical Practice, I first searched up medical practice apps and 3 popped up "Virtual Practice Healthcare, Jotform Health, and NHS App". But the one that looked more intresting was Virtual Practice Healthcare with the loco being a stethoscope. 
* Healthcare tech is moving fast, its mostly from mobile apps.  Virtual Practice Healthcare apps  let doctors and patients connect online, so people will be able to get care from home. Instead of going to a doctor’s office, patients  will be able to  have video calls, ask questions, and even get prescriptions all right from their phone. It makes healthcare easier and more convenient, especially when you can't make it to a clinic or prefer not to leave the house.
